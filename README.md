Project Title: Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze restaurant reviews and classify them based on customer sentiment. The classification task aims to determine whether a customer liked or disliked the restaurant based on their review. By leveraging Python's data analysis tools and machine learning algorithms, the project will develop a model capable of predicting customer satisfaction.

Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Machine Learning Libraries (such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch)
Steps Involved:

Data Collection: The dataset consists of restaurant reviews along with labels indicating whether the customer liked the experience (1) or not (0).
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization.
Feature Extraction: Convert the text reviews into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Building: Train a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks) to predict whether a review is positive or negative.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: The model could be deployed as part of a recommendation system or integrated into restaurant feedback platforms.
Potential Applications:

Predict customer satisfaction based on their reviews.
Help restaurants improve by identifying common negative feedback.
Enhance customer service by prioritizing negative reviews for prompt responses.
